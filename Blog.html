I realized after some tinkering the simple mistake that was causing it to not register and was able to figure it out!.</h4>

			<h4><center>introduction to php functions and strings  ...✎</center></h4>
			<h4 class="blog-time">| february 26th 2023 | <i>11:59pm</i> ☾</h4>
			<h4 class="blog-text">Within PHP, functions and strings are connected in that functions can manipulate strings in a variety of ways, such as saying how many characters there are within one, and strings themselves can be passed through functions as arguments to allow for a variety of unique aspects to happen, such as customizing a greeting to someone's name.<br>I implemented both functions and strings on my website in that I used a function to display a string to viewers and then used the function "strlen" to show the viewer the number of characters within that string.<br><br>٩(ˊᗜˋ*) [ what was easy ]<br><br>Creating the PHP code, both for the function question along with the string one, were relatively easy once I became familiar with the structure of PHP itself since it is new to me.<br><br>(₇´п`)₇ [ what was hard ]<br><br>I was slightly confused at first when it came to saving the file as a .php instead of .html. Even though that is what we were instructed to do and I was aware I would not be able to view it in a browser unless it was actively on my site, when I went to view it there was just the code. Again, I am completely new to PHP so this was mildly concerning, along with the fact that in the editor I use it showed the code in an odd way, but given that the presentations warned of this and it was fine after submitting it to my website, all was well!</h4>

			<h3 class="blog-header">ㅤmodule 8 ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ⋆˚✿˖°˖</h3>
			<h4><center>html forms in php and working with files  ...✎</center></h4>
			<h4 class="blog-time">| march 5th 2023 | <i>11:59pm</i> ☾</h4>
			<h4 class="blog-text">The main differences between $_GET and $_POST are visibility and size limitations. With $_GET, information sent from a form, such as variable names and values, are visible to everyone in the browser's address bar and has a size limit of 100 characters for any value. With $_POST, information sent from a form is <b>not</b> visible to others and the size limit is 8 mb, but this limit can be changed within the php.ini file. Typically $_GET is good to implement if a website may want to be bookmarked, but $_POST is better when dealing with potentially sensitive information within forms, such as passwords.</1_><br><br>٩(ˊᗜˋ*) [ what was easy ]<br><br>Creating the form and passing the information to the PHP file. I used my form from Module 5 and slightly adjusted it to suit this Module, so that made things a lot easier as well.<br><br>(₇´п`)₇ [ what was hard ]<br><br>Figuring out just exactly how to do a few IF statements so I could get the outputted message to be value-specfic (for the visitor's favorite color). Also trying to format font size within the PHP code and implementing transitions for some of the text was a little confusing at first, but I got it sorted!</h4>

			<h4 class="blog-time">| march 12th 2023 | <i>11:59pm</i> ☾</h4>
			<h4 class="blog-text">Firstly I went to my infinity free account and went to the PHP and MySQL tabs to create my table. I named it assignment and added 4 different variables: first name, last name, age, and message. I assigned the corresponding values to each variable, such as INT and VARCHAR. I then inserted the test data provided, "Test", "Big Test", and so on to finish up the assignment.</1_><br><br>٩(ˊᗜˋ*) [ what was easy ]<br><br>Creating the table for the assignment was relatively easy, but I did hit a minor roadblock. I kept pressing "Go" and it was not saving the table. I later realized I was not giving it enough time to load and save, so I got it created!<br><br>(₇´п`)₇ [ what was hard ]<br><br>Connecting the PHP form values to the database I had trouble with. I kept getting my error message of "database connection failed" and took a while to figure out what was wrong. Eventually I figured out I was giving the wrong values for certain variables, such as $host and $password. Luckily I got it figured out and accessing the actual data collected within the database proved no problem.</h4>

			<h4 class="blog-text">Note: Given that there was no assignment listed for this week, there is just this blog post for module 10!</1_><br><br>٩(ˊᗜˋ*) [ what was easy ]<br><br>Once again creating a database and corresponding table with the correct values was easy since we had to do that last module as well. Luckily, last module I dealt with connecting to the database server and further with sending information to the table, so that was easy to do as well (in this instance I have been using the form I used for module 9 to collect such data for my table).<br><br>(₇´п`)₇ [ what was hard ]<br><br>I did not experience any major difficulties this time around as again, since I acknowledged connecting to and sending information to the server last module, I had it all figured out with no trouble!</h4>

			<h4><center>the future of web technologies  ...✎</center></h4>
			<h4 class="blog-time">| april 2nd 2023 | <i>11:59pm</i> ☾</h4>
			<h4 class="blog-text">Note: Given that there was no assignment listed for this week, there is just this blog post for module 11! As a brief overview regarding the video provided in this module, about the future of web applications and the tutorial itself, it was incredibly intriguing. Surprisingly (or not), I have only heard of GitHub but never really seen it or known how it works, but this video gave me a good idea of it. The whole process of creating users for a proposed web application seemed like a confusing yet fascinating process. I did not know what was going on mostly in the video, but I learned along the way!</1_><br><br>٩(ˊᗜˋ*) [ what was easy ]<br><br>Everything! There was no assignment and I do not have any questions as of now for the final project, but if that changes I will be sure to reach out!<br><br>(₇´п`)₇ [ what was hard ]<br><br>Nothing (again since there was no assignment this time)!</h4>
